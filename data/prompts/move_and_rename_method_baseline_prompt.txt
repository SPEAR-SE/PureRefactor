1. Analyze the provided code, class content, and project structure, apply move and rename method operation to the code to be refactored, output the target file path, moved class code, and refactored method code.
Need to move to an existing java file
The moved method code should be updated to the public static method.
The refactored method code should use the moved class to call the moved method.
